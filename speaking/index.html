<h1>Speaking</h1>

<p>Some of my research talks from conferences are collected below.</p>

<p><strong>7th Workshop on Operator Algebras and their Applications</strong>, IPM Tehran, Iran, January 2020. <a href="http://math.ipm.ac.ir/conferences/2020/OpeAlg2020/">Conference website</a> <br />
Abstract: Multipliers of a discrete group can be used to characterise approximation properties of the associated reduced group C*-algebra. These techniques have proved influential in the theory of approximation properties of C*-algebras: they have shed new light on some C*-algebra properties and motivated the introduction and study of others. I will begin by introducing multipliers defined on a group, and describe how they can be used to characterise approximation properties of the reduced group C*-algebra. I will then discuss some of the difficulties one encounters in trying to describe approximation properties of the reduced crossed product C*-algebra associated to a group action. To get around these difficulties I will introduce multipliers of group actions, which generalize multipliers of groups, and explain how these allow us to characterise approximation properties of reduced crossed products, as well as give new proofs of existing results on such properties.<br />
