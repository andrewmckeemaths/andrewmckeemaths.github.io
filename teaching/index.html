<h1>Teaching</h1>

<p>In the current semester I am teaching three courses.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Basic Category Theory</em> Pedagogical lecture course.</li>
    <li><em>The Banach-Tarski Paradox</em> Pedagogical lecture course.<a href="UwBteaching/BanachTarskiParadoxMcKee.pdf" target="_blank">Lecture notes.</a></li>  
    <li><em>Master Seminar I</em> Student seminar course with the goal of developing mathematical English skills.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Notes from these courses will be added when they are ready.</p>

<h2>2021</h2>

<p>In the semester March to June 2021 I taught three courses.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>New Trends: Multipliers</em> Pedagogical lecture course.</li>
    <li><em>Quantum Information Theory</em> Pedagogical lecture course.</li>  
    <li><em>Scholarly English</em> Student seminar course with the goal of developing mathematical English skills.</li>
  </ul>


<h2>2020</h2>

<p>At the University of Bialystok I was responsible for two courses in the semester October 2020 to February 2021.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>The Banach-Tarski paradox</em> Pedagogical lecture course. <a href="UwBteaching/BanachTarskiParadoxMcKee.pdf" target="_blank">Lecture notes.</a></li>  
    <li><em>Master's seminar 1</em> Student seminar course with the goal of developing mathematical English skills. <a href="UwBteaching/EnglishPresentationNotes.pdf" target="_blank">Summary of the main points we discussed.</a></li>
  </ul>

<p>During spring 2020 I supervised a group of students from Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg during their Bachelor project on the Banach-Tarski Paradox.</p>

<h2>2019</h2>

<p>I was free to do research for all of 2019!</p>

<h2>2018</h2>

<p>At the University of Saskatchewan I was responsible for the <em>Calculus 1</em> Math 110 course in spring 2018 and the <em>Calculus 2</em> Math 116 course in summer 2018, based on Stewart's <em>Calculus: early transcendentals</em>. As part of these courses I produced several resources, available here.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="UofSteaching/FormulaSheet.pdf" target="_blank">Formula sheet</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="UofSteaching/Calc1Summary.pdf" target="_blank">Calculus 1 notes</a> and <a href="UofSteaching/Calc1SampleExamQus.pdf" target="_blank">sample exam questions</a> with solutions.</li>
    <li><a href="UofSteaching/Calc2Summary.pdf" target="_blank">Calculus 2 notes</a> and <a href="UofSteaching/Calc2SampleExamQus.pdf" target="_blank">sample exam questions</a> with solutions.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Please let me know if you notice any mistakes in these notes. I have also produced other resources, including a collection of exam questions and solutions for these courses; any instructor who would like a copy of any of these documents is welcome to contact me.</p>
